## [0.0.2] - Snapshot
  ### Added
  - Added work in progress lisb api doc
  - Added machine-headers refinement, implementation, model and system.
  - Added translation of USES, EXTENDS, INCLUDES, SEES, PROMOTES and operation substitutions.
  - Added parameter support to machine-name.
  - Added multiple arguments for constraints, properties, invariants and init.
      Arguments for constraints, properties and invariants are chained via AConjunctPredicate.
      Arguments for init are chained via ASequenceSubstitution.
  - Added example sebastian with tests.
  - Added multi-arity for subset and strict-subset.
  - Added multi-arity for contains.
  - Added cartesian-product and mul to lisb-dsl and ir.
  - Added lisb-dsl:
      equivalence -> bequivalence,
      implication -> bimplication,
      in -> bmember,
      π -> bpi,
      Σ -> bsigma,
      successor -> bsuccessor,
      predecessor -> bpredecessor,
      div -> bdiv,
      direct-product -> bdirect-product,
      override -> boverride,
      range-subtraction -> brange-subtraction,
      range-restriction -> brange-restriction,
      domain-subtraction -> bdomain-subtraction,
      domain-restriction -> bdomain-restriction,
      |-> bmaplet,
      relation -> brelation,
      <<-> -> btotal-relation,
      <->> -> bsurjective-relation,
      <<->> -> btotal-surjective-relation,
      <- -> bappend,
      -> -> bprepend,
      || -> bparallel-sub,
      becomes-member -> bbecomes-element-of,
      set! -> bassign
  ### Changed
